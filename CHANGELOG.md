All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.0.5] - 2026-08-24

### Changed

- Built on oxml 0.0.5, which completes `XPath` 1.0: all thirteen axes
  and all 27 functions.

  **One behaviour change reaches expressions passed through this
  crate.** A function name outside the specification's library, or a
  call with the wrong number of arguments, used to compile and evaluate
  to an empty node-set. Both are now compile errors, reported with an
  offset. `starts-with("abc")` answered `true` before, because the
  absent argument read as the empty string.

  Six functions that previously answered `""` now work:
  `substring-before`, `substring-after`, `translate`, `name`, `id` and
  `lang`. So do the `following`, `preceding` and `namespace` axes.

## [0.0.4] - 2026-08-24

### Added

- An optional array of `"PREFIX=URI"` bindings on `queryText`,
  `queryValue` and `queryCount`. oxml 0.0.4 resolves prefixes in
  `XPath` name tests instead of matching on the local part alone.

## [0.0.3] - 2026-08-22

### Added

- Initial release. WebAssembly bindings for oxml: XML parsing and XPath in the browser
- Tracks the version line of the [`oxml`](https://github.com/sebastienrousseau/oxml)
  core, so a given version of any suite member is built and tested against
  the matching core.

[0.0.3]: https://github.com/sebastienrousseau/oxml-wasm/releases/tag/v0.0.3
